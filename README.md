## ‚öôÔ∏è JavaScript Integration

JavaScript will be used on the **Discography** page for interactive album previews.

When users hover or click on an album cover, it will:
- Display the album name, release date, and tracklist dynamically.
- Allow users to switch between albums without reloading the page.

**Example Script:**
```js
const albums = {
  'READY TO BE': ['SET ME FREE', 'MOONLIGHT SUNRISE', 'BLAME IT ON ME'],
  'BETWEEN 1&2': ['Talk that Talk', 'Queen of Hearts', 'Basics']
};

function showAlbum(name) {
  const trackList = albums[name];
  let output = `<h3>${name}</h3><ul>`;
  trackList.forEach(track => {
    output += `<li>${track}</li>`;
  });
  output += '</ul>';
  document.getElementById('albumInfo').innerHTML = output;
}
